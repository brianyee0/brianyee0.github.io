I love pictures like this, of the Earth and the Moon in one frame:

This image was taken by Voyager 1, the first of its kind. Â Â There’s more information about the photo [here](http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_rec.php?id=546). Â A more recent photo was taken by the MESSENGER spacecraft en route to orbit Mercury:

This photo was taken from about the same distance from the Earth as Mercury. Â Stunning.
