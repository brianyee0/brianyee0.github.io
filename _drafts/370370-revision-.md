Wonderful post on AviationIntel.com about the history of the US’ newest spyplane, the [RQ-170 Sentinel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_RQ-170_Sentinel)Â which was used in the [Osama Bin Laden raid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Osama_bin_Laden) and most famously was [forced to land in Iran](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93U.S._RQ-170_incident). Â The post traces the origin of the airplane from early technology demonstrators. Â I love reading about the covert programs of the US military and intelligence programs and wonder what other yet-to-be-disclosed airplane programs
