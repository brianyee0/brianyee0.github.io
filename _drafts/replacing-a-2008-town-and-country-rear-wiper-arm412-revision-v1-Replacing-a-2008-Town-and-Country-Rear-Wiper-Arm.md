I’m posting this to save someone else some trouble since I had trouble figuring out what exactly needed to be done. Â I had a 2008 Town and Country (and I assume these instructions are the same for the 2008 Caravan and Grand Caravan) that had the rear wiper arm begin to turn freely. Â I also found through researching that the OEM plastic arm had been replaced by Mopar to be a metal arm (which isn’t surprising since the failure was the plastic housing cracking releasing tension on the motor arm).

I ordered the replacement parts on Amazon.com (and Amazon says they do not fit, but in fact they do):

The most difficult part was removing the metal ring from the old arm still attached to the motor shaft. Â I had a hard time figuring out that this was a separate piece and not just part of the motor shaft (anyone in the Amazon.com comments that says this part does not fit did not remove this part). Â For an explanation of what this is and how to remove it (I also used a hacksaw), watch this video — which is for a Passat, but the process is the same. Â VW and Chrysler must share parts.

That was it, put the new arm on after making sure it has been reset to its “Off” position. Â Tighten the nut, put the cap on, and test it. Â Not so bad.
