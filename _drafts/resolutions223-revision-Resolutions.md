I always thought it was a little lame to do this, but that never stopped me before. Â He’s the small list I wrote down last week:

**1. INBOX ZERO EVERY DAY**

> At least at work, get things organized out of the inbox and into a task list of some sort. Â It is pleasing to look down to a clean inbox, helps to feel that things are in order.

**2. PLAY LESS WOW**

> As fun as it is, it’s really just a time sink — time I could be using for something more useful.

**3. CREATE SOMETHING REGULARLY**

> Spend some time doing something creative, doesn’t matter what.

**4. DON’T WAIT, ACT NOW**

> Shannon knows I’m a procrastinator. Â So I’ll try to work on that a bit.

**5. HAVE NO RESOLUTIONS NEXT YEAR**

> Would be nice to not be able to come up with a list like this.
