Before launches at [Baikonur Cosmodrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikonur_Cosmodrome) in Kazakhstan, Helicopters search the downrange path of rockets to find any nomads in the vast grasslands of Kazakhstan. Ã‚ If any are found they are warned of the upcoming launched.

This picture of this activity was particularly interesting:

The americans launch with ocean downrange. and a similar search is performed for boats that are in the wrong spot.
