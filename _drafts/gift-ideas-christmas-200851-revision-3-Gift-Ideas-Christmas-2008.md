I need a place to store my ideas as they come in — so for my own reference as well as other’s:

[320GB Portable HDD](http://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-Passport-Essential-WDME3200TN/dp/B0012GQZZU/ref=cm_lmf_tit_14_rsrsrs0)

Computer Parts (need links).

Amazon gift card are always nice if you can’t find something specific (convenient and they have everything).

also, a link to my [Amazon Wish List](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/7NTY0TKR1PKB)Â which has a lot of other ideas i’ve collected.
