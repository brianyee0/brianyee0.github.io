Yesterday’s [Astronomy Picture of the Day](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100111.html) was pretty neat. Â It was an astronaut grabbing a rather large satellite in an untethered spacewalk.

The picture doesn’t capture really what’s happening here. Â The satellite is rotating while being captured. Â The [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR6jlWBeHvY) shows this better. Shannon couldn’t believe what she was seeing. Â “Is he crazy!” seems like what Not surprisingly, NASA stopped the practice of untether spacewalks after the Challenger accident.

This reminded me of an interesting anecdote from Mike Mullane’s [Riding Rockets](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743276833?ie=UTF8&tag=byee-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0743276833)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=byee-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0743276833) on risks in spaceflight. Â The shuttle engineers had found a very rare but potential flaw with the shuttle that might prevent the solid rocket boosters from separating (which would be fatal to the crew). Â They had asked the astronauts if they would still launch knowing the risk. Â That astronaut’s response:

> They might as well have asked a three-year-old if he wanted to eat his candy now or wait until tomorrow. Â If the engineers said, “We forgot to install the center engine. Â Do you still want to launch?” Hank (astronaut Hank Hartsfield) probably would have said, “No problem. Â We’ll just burn the two we have.” Â Nothing was going to get in our way.

The business of being an astronaut is extremely risky. Â I wonder if I could fly in the face of those risks.
