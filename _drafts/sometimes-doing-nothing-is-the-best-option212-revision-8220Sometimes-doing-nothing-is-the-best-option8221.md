Great post by NASA’s Wayne Hale on his [blog](http://blogs.nasa.gov/cm/blog/waynehalesblog) regarding conjuctions, or close encounters between the Space Shuttle and space junk. Â When a conjunction is going to occur during the crew sleep period and there is sufficient reason to believe there will not be a collision, mission controllers will set a timer to expire at the Time of Closest Approach and everyone would hope they did their math correctly. Â This happened three times during Wayne’s tenure in Mission Control. Â His quote:

> So as we waited for the clock to count to zero, there was plenty of time to contemplate metaphysical topics:Â Â life, death, courage, risk, achievement, probability, dishonor.Â Â They are all fellow travelers, intimately bound together.Â Â No great accomplishment comes without difficulty or risk.Â Â Miscalculation or failure results in death and dishonor.Â Â But it is what it is; you do the best you can, make the best rational choice you can given what you know, and then wait for the result.

I follow Wayne Hale on twitter ([@waynehale](http://twitter.com/waynehale)) and I am always impressed with his insights and thoughts on the space program.
