I tried to stay up to watch the start of the rollout live, but it got delayed about an hour, so I’m glad I didn’t. Â The last rocked to rollout from the VAB that wasn’t the shuttle was [ASTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo-Soyuz_Test_Project) (on a Saturn 1B), which rolled to pad 39B on March 24 1975. Â It’s neat to finally see something new.
