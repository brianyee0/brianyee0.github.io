I saw Air Force One earlier today as it flew over Dearborn. Â President Obama spoke at the University of Michigan earlier today. Â Using the [NOTAM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOTAM) information, I knew the approximate arrival time and kept an eye out. Â Here’s the photo I snapped:

Pretty neat that I got to see it…
