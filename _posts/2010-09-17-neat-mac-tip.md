I like sites like [lifehacker.com](http://lifehacker.com), but I find that there are usually nice suggestions, but that I really pick up on some of their suggestions immediate. But this one I really got me and is turning out to be very useful.

The tip is: use “option” on a mac to open a new window in that application. It’s something I usually like to do in Chrome or Finder — but now I can do easily with a keystroke. (I try to keep my hands on the keyboard as much as possible).

The only problem: Getting your fingers in the right spot isn’t easy — I’ll have to work on that one.
