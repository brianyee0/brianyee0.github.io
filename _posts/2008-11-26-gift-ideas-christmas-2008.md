I need a place to store my ideas as they come in — so for my own reference as well as other’s:

[320GB Portable HDD](http://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-Passport-Essential-WDME3200TN/dp/B0012GQZZU/ref=cm_lmf_tit_14_rsrsrs0)

[500GB External HDD](http://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-500-Book-Essential/dp/B000XRK3LG/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1228009948&sr=8-2)

[Computer Parts (Amazon Wish List)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2Q8DEDZYSAX44)

Amazon gift card are always nice if you can’t find something specific (convenient and they have everything).

also, a link to my generalÂ [Amazon Wish List](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/7NTY0TKR1PKB) which has a lot of other ideas i’ve collected.
