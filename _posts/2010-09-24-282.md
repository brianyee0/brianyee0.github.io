I came across [this list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_human_spaceflights) at Wikipedia (not surprisingly, about spaceflight). Â It lists \*every\* human spaceflight since April 12, 1961 (Vostok 1). Â And the total surprised me:

282

Only 282 flights with humans in over 49 years. Â Less than 6 per year on average. Â This includes 3 flights from the X-15 program and 3 flights from SpaceShipOne Â — both non-traditional spaceflights.

After Yuri Gagarin orbited the Earth almost 50 years ago, I wonder how many flights the people at Roscosmos and NASA thought there would be at this point.
