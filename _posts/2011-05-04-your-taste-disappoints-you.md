[Great interview](http://kottke.org/11/04/your-taste-is-why-your-own-work-disappoints-you) with Ira Glass (from [This American Life](http://www.thislife.org)) regarding storytelling, but more generally…creating.

<span style="font-family: MyriadPro-Regular, Myriad Pro Regular, MyriadPro, Myriad Pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 23px; font-size: small;">Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit.</span>

Don’t give up.

He goes on to say that the most important thing you can do to get over this is: do a huge volume of work. Basically, practice.

So, I’ll try not to judge myself too harshly and keep working at the things I love…
