NASA released the updated manifest for the last 10 space shuttle flights a few days ago.Â If you’re interested in seeing a launch, there are only 10 left.Â After mid-year 2010, the [next manned launched](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_2) likely will not occur until 2014.

> Two more shuttle flights are planned this year, in October and November, five in 2009 and a final three missions in the first half of 2010 to bring the program to a close.
> 
> NASA had planned to retire the shuttle Atlantis after a final Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission in October, but the orbiter will make two more flights beyond that, one in 2009 and another in 2010, to provide additional processing margin. Atlantis and Discovery will fly three more times each and the shuttle Endeavour will make four more flights, including the 10th and final mission.
