I’m posting this to save someone else some trouble since I had trouble figuring out what exactly needed to be done. Â I had a 2008 Town and Country (and I assume these instructions are the same for the 2008 Caravan and Grand Caravan) that had the rear wiper arm begin to turn freely. Â I also found through researching that the OEM plastic arm had been replaced by Mopar to be a metal arm (which isn’t surprising since the failure was the plastic housing cracking releasing tension on the motor arm).

I ordered the replacement parts on Amazon.com (and Amazon says they do not fit, but in fact they do):

Wiper Arm Cover Cap: [99-04 Jeep Grand Cherokee &amp; 08-09 Caravan T&amp;C Rear Wiper Arm Cover Cap MOPAR OEM](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B1FOVU8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00B1FOVU8&linkCode=as2&tag=briyee-20&linkId=ETE3UBQNDNCTTHLR)![](http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=briyee-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00B1FOVU8)

Wiper Arm: [Mopar 6807 8306AA, Windshield Wiper Arm](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007NNFEGM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007NNFEGM&linkCode=as2&tag=briyee-20&linkId=XGGHSEK57EM2SQUZ)![](http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=briyee-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B007NNFEGM)

New Wiper Blade: [Mopar 6807 8307AA, Windshield Wiper Blade](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007NNEIKK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007NNEIKK&linkCode=as2&tag=briyee-20&linkId=GWLBCWG33B4YIHR6)![](http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=briyee-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B007NNEIKK)

The most difficult part was removing the metal ring from the old arm still attached to the motor shaft. Â I had a hard time figuring out that this was a separate piece and not just part of the motor shaft (anyone in the Amazon.com comments that says this part does not fit did not remove this part). Â For an explanation of what this is and how to remove it (I also used a hacksaw), watch this video — which is for a Passat, but the process is the same. Â VW and Chrysler must share parts.

That was it, put the new arm on after making sure it has been reset to its “Off” position. Â Tighten the nut, put the cap on, and test it. Â Not so bad.
