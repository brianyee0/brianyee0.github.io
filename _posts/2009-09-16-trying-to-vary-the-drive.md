I’ve been trying a few ways home from work (the general idea courtesy of [Blue Racecar](http://blueracecar.wordpress.com/)). Â Second number is up until my freeway exit — not sure why I’m keeping track of that, but I thought I’d eliminate any variance in the part of the drive that I can’t really change.

Variation 1 (10-&gt;94-&gt;96):

**9/14**: 28.29.9 (23.41.2) – Â time slightly off because I stopped to get gas, but I played with the timer to approximate cutting that out…

Variation 1a (96-&gt;Wyoming-&gt;10-&gt;Davison-&gt;75)

**9/15**: 31:43.4 (25.59.3) –
