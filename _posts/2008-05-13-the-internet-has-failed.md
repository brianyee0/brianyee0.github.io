<div class="text">Have you ever seen a garage door with a black silhouette of an ox and a covered wagon? I have. Those used to be on every street in my neighborhood growing up.

Well, apparently no pictures of this exist on the internet.

Not one.

The people I work with are fairly internet savvy. Perhaps more than the average office worker given that we do work on web sites.

We cannot find one.

My theory that these things pre-dated the interwebs was invalidated by Mike, who said “There are pictures of John F Kennedy or FDR, and they pre-dated the internets”.

Oh well. If someone can link to a picture of something like this, let me know.
