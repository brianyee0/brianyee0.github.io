One of the things I’ve been looking forward to recently is the rollout (on 10/20) and the launch (scheduled for 10/27) of Â [Ares I-X](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/constellation/ares/flighttests/aresIx/index.html): NASA’s first test flight of the new rockets in support of the [Constellation Program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation_program) (created by Bush II in his Vision for Space Exploration).

It’s been exciting to read about the development, creation, and assembly of the new rockets — the first new thing from NASA since the launch of [STS-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-1) in 1981. Â Even more exciting, in a different sort of way, is to read the debates going on right now on the web and trying to figure out what’s going to happen next. Â There’s been a review of the entire program by the Augustine Commission — and the future direction of NASA is going to announced soon by new NASA administrator Charles Bolden.

Whether or not Ares I continues development, it’s still an exciting time in Human Spaceflight…even if you only get to watch from the sidelines.
