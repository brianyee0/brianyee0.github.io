Also, there are pictures of Shannon’s preschool ESL class [here](/shannon/class01).

This [post](http://kottke.org/notes/0106.html#010621) on [Jason Kottke’s](http://www.kottke.org/) weblog kind of sums up some things I’ve been thinking about lately: How much the internet, or the web, amazes me.

Everytime I think about some of the services that the internet can provide, it amazes me: [package tracking](http://www.ups.com/tracking/tracking.html) and [instant messaging](http://www.aol.com/aim/) to name a few. Online shopping, too. I was thinking the other day about the amount of information I take for granted these days, I wouldn’t know where to find things without the internet. What did people do just ten years ago? What did I do? The other day I needed to find out where the area code [847](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&q=area+code+847&spell=1) was. I found out in about 3 seconds. What else would I do…go to the library?

Also, I just noticed that [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect-home/byee-20) is giving free shipping when you buy two cds. I think I’ll have to take them up on that.
