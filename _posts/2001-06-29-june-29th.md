Are these two logos ([\#1](http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00003CXC3.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg) and [\#2](http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/diaries/)) totally the same? I guess they’re not exact on closer inspection, but both Shannon and I immediately though they were after seeing the preview for the upcoming movie on tv. They’re pretty close.

Also, scandal in the voting process! Suspected voter fraud in the [Road to Springfield](http://www.roadtosprinfield.com/) tournament. In the matchup between [Lionel Hutz](http://www.snpp.com/guides/hutz.file.html) and [Diamond Joe Quimby](http://www.quimby2000.com/), no less.

I only slept about 2 hours last night, if that…stupid acid reflux. I knew I shouldn’t have eaten the whole thing.
