Last weekend I made pulled pork, my first time doing real Barbeque, not regular grilling, but low and slow hours long Barbeque. Â Joe, from work, had sent me a few links on some techniques. Â But not too long after looking for some more information I found the Â [Virtual Weber Bullet](http://www.virtualweberbullet.com/) site, then I found [weber\_cam](http://webercam.com).Â After reading a few posts from these places I found new inspiration for documenting what I’ve been doing and the things that interest me — perhaps for the only purpose of writing it down to learn from it later: sort of a personal logbook.

Here’s what I’m interesting in looking into next:

\* Homebrew: not sure if I’ll really do this. Â I probably need to drink more to make this worthwhile.

\* Getting back into RC planes: I never really flew one very successfully and this would be great to have a new start in. Â I’ve already spent a fair bit in the up-front costs. Â I’ll probably need to get new batteries.

\* More Barbeque

\* Perfecting baguettes. Â weber\_cam has some good techniques and videos that I’m going to try.

So with that, I begin. Â We’ll find out how long the inspiration lasts this time.
