As parents, we often look to certain growth milestones with longing. Â Asking ourselves “When will my son start walking?” or thinking out load “Boy, it would be nice if my daughter could talk” — unknowing to the fact that once a child starts talking they never, ever, ever stop.

It’s this latest milestone that my daughter has reached that has begun this whole cycle anew: reading.

When your child can’t read yet, it’s easy to control the information they receive. Â If you don’t want them to know about some of the options on the menu, you don’t it read them. Â You get used to have this superpower…and then everything changes.

Today I was walking through Target with my daughter when a non-descript package caught her eye. “Cotton candy?! Â Dad, that says cotton candy. Â Can we get some?”. Â Great.

Oh, I remember the good ol’ days when my daughter was illiterate.
