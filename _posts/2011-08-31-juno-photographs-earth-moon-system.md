I’ve posted about [this in the past](http://blog.brianyee.org/the-earth-and-the-moon), but this type of photograph is my favorite. Juno, the recently launched probe to Jupiter, recently captured a single frame in which the Earth and the Moon were both visible.

I love this because it gives you a radically different perpective on the moon when you look up at in the sky. It seems so close, but in this photo you can see how far away it really is.

I love this because it clearly demonstrates the vastness of emptyness that surrounds us.

I love this because it describes vividly how far humans themselves have been able to explore, from the dot on the left to the dot on the right at its full extreme.

Take a minute to look and ponder.
