Two applications have really helped me deal with managing my time and the information I need to process everyday. [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com) and [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/):

[Instapaper](http://instapaper.com) is a simple site that allows you to mark sites to real later. That’s it. It’s a true member of the “one thing well” family of sites. I can mark things to read from my iPhone, work computer, and home computer and work through them when I have time. It even has great integration with Google Reader.

The second is [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/). I use [Getting Things Done](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) to manage everything while at work, keeping things out of my head and out of my inbox to manage my next actions and when things are due. It’s a great piece of software. (However, it lacks syncing between my phone and another computer — a feature the team is actively working on, so I’ve been trying out [Remember the Milk](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/) in the meantime. Not as impressed.)

What do you use?
