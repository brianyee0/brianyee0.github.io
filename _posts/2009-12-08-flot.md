Joe ([@szac](http://twitter.com/szac)) turned me on to [Flot](http://code.google.com/p/flot/) for a project he’s working on. Â I’m helping him out with some php logic. Â Flot a pretty nifty graphing library all in javascript. Â The [examples](http://people.iola.dk/olau/flot/examples/) show that it’s capable of a lot: multiple axes, multiple series, highlighting, and all can be updated real-time using Ajax. Â But at its simplest — give it some properties, a data set, and it’s off and running. Â Actually forget the properties, it will compute a logical set of axes for you if you want.

That Flot does all of this in javascript (via canvas painting) is all pretty amazing to me. Â To me, javascript is still what you use to make those mouseover nav links that change state. Â My javascript chops never really progressed beyond the web circa-1998.
