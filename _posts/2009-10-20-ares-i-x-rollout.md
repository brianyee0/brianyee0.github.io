I tried to stay up to watch the start of the rollout live – scheduled for 12:01AM this morning, but it got delayed about an hour, so I’m glad I didn’t. Â The last bit of the rollout is happening right now.

Someone on the nasaspaceflight.com forum this morning noted that the last rocked to rollout from the VAB that wasn’t the shuttle was [ASTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo-Soyuz_Test_Project) (on a Saturn 1B), which rolled to pad 39B on March 24 1975. Â It was an interesting sense of scale. Â And it’s neat to finally see something new.
